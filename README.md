ðŸŽ¨ Color Detection Project Using OpenCV and Pandas

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Color Detection is a basic but powerful computer vision project where you can detect the name and RGB values of any color in an image by clicking on it. This is useful in graphic design, image editing applications, and color blindness assistance tools.

With the help of OpenCV and Pandas, this project builds an interactive tool that detects the closest named color for any pixel clicked in an image.
